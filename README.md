# React + Vite

I used this site to learn how to deploy this app made with React and Vite to Github Pages:
https://medium.com/@badreddine.boudaoud21/create-a-react-app-with-vite-and-deploy-it-on-github-48b82e19f821

Everything below here is stuff that vite added on its own. I don't know if it's important, so I'll just leave it there.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
